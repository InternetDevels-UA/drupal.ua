"This site supports <a href=\"@openid-net\">OpenID</a>, a secure way to log "

"the necessity of managing many usernames and passwords for many websites."

"To use OpenID you must first establish an identity on a public or private "
"OpenID server. If you do not have an OpenID and would like one, look into "
"one of the <a href=\"@openid-providers\">free public providers</a>. You can "
"find out more about OpenID at <a href=\"@openid-net\">this website</a>."

"If you already have an OpenID, enter the URL to your OpenID server below (e."
"g. myusername.openidprovider.com). Next time you login, you will be able to "
"use this URL instead of a regular username and password. You can have "
"multiple OpenID servers if you like; just keep adding them here."

"OpenID is a secure method for logging into many websites with a single "
"username and password. It does not require special software, and it does not "
"share passwords with any site to which it is associated; including your site."

"Users can create accounts using their OpenID, assign one or more OpenIDs to "
"an existing account, and log in using an OpenID. This lowers the barrier to "
"registration, which is good for the site, and offers convenience and "
"security to the users. OpenID is not a trust system, so email verification "
"is still necessary. The benefit stems from the fact that users can have a "
"single password that they can use on many websites. This means they can "
"easily update their single password from a centralized location, rather than "
"having to change dozens of passwords individually."

msgid ""
"The basic concept is as follows: A user has an account on an OpenID server. "
"This account provides them with a unique URL (such as myusername."
"openidprovider.com). When the user comes to your site, they are presented "
"with the option of entering this URL. Your site then communicates with the "
"OpenID server, asking it to verify the identity of the user. If the user is "
"logged into their OpenID server, the server communicates back to your site, "
"verifying the user. If they are not logged in, the OpenID server will ask "
"the user for their password. At no point does your site record, or need to "
"record the user's password."
