All modules should be written to support some functionality.

You should not put a lot of unrelated things in one module,
except for the cases where these changes are related to some
section or functionality and it's really hard to divide it
into submodules.

In cases, when you see that some modules are making a category
of functionality, create a folder for them and "svn move" them
to this folder to keep nice code structure.

If you need to write some kind of one-time-using module, put
it to "_temp".
